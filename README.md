 # 🏦 Bank Management System (OOP Version)

A professional financial administration tool entirely refactored from procedural C++ to a robust, modular **Object-Oriented Architecture**.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Object-Oriented Architecture:** Entirely redesigned using core OOP principles: Inheritance, Abstraction, and Encapsulation.

* **Modular Screen System:** Every functionality (Login, Transactions, User Management) is isolated in its own dedicated class for maximum scalability.

* **User Authentication & Permissions:** Secure login system with a granular permissions bit-mask to control user access levels.

* **Comprehensive Logging:** Automated registration system for all Login activities and Transfer transactions into dedicated log files.

* **Advanced Utility Libraries:** Custom-built classes for robust input validation (`clsInputValidate`), complex date handling (`clsDate`), and advanced string manipulation (`clsString`).

## 🛠️ Built With

* **Language Standard:** C++20.

* **Architecture:** Modular Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

* **IDE:** Developed using Microsoft Visual Studio.
