A specialized financial tool developed in C++ designed for secure client management and real-time transaction tracking through an intuitive console interface.

🚀 Key Features
**Client Management: Executes complete CRUD operations (Add, Delete, Update, and Find).
**Transactions Module: Handles deposits and withdrawals with real-time balance validation.
**Data Persistence: Navigates data seamlessly by loading and saving to a flat-file database (Clients.txt).
**User Interface: Organizes operations through a clean, menu-driven system for enhanced user experience.


🛠️ Built With
**Language: C++
**Libraries: Standard Template Library (STL) - Vectors, Strings, Algorithms.
**Storage: File Streaming (fstream) for persistent data storage.


📖 How to Use
**Clone the repository:
**Bash
**git clone https://github.com/khaledwaled21/Bank-Management-System-CPP.git
**Compile the source code: Compile the Bank_Project.cpp file using any C++ compiler (G++, MSVC).
**Setup Data File: Important: Ensure the Clients.txt file is in the same directory as the executable file before running to allow the program to load/save data.
**Run the application: Follow the on-screen menu instructions to manage clients and transactions.


📈 Future Improvements
**[ ] Transform the procedural logic into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
**[ ] Implement a Transaction History log file.
